        The product is BlueOcean Pay, a payment aggregation platform primarily focused on overseas versions of WeChat Pay, Alipay, and other payment methods. The project has investment from a Hong Kong team, and the initial phase of business operations was launched in Hong Kong. The ultimate vision is to provide fast and convenient payment services for Chinese tourists worldwide. The main achievement in terms of business is facilitating cross-border payments for general tourists, allowing them to directly use mainland WeChat Wallet and Alipay Wallet, with automatic conversion of intermediate fees. This model greatly benefits both tourists and merchants.

        In the early stages of the project, my main responsibility was to develop and refine the payment platform's functionalities. In the later stages, I focused on promoting and integrating payment interfaces with external parties. The payment backend functionalities were developed using the Laravel framework, while the payment interfaces were implemented using the Phalcon framework. Throughout my work, I utilized various productivity tools such as Trello and Slack.

    The interests section in a resume typically refers to a section where you can mention your hobbies, interests, and activities outside of work or school. This section can give potential employers a better idea of your personality, your values, and your interests beyond your professional experience.

    Including an interest section in your resume can be helpful if your interests are relevant to the job you are applying for, such as if you are applying for a job in a creative field and your hobbies include painting or writing. It can also be useful if you are applying for a job where teamwork or social skills are important, and you can mention interests that demonstrate those qualities.

    However, it is important to be selective when including an interest section in your resume, and to choose interests that are appropriate and professional. Avoid including controversial or potentially offensive interests, and focus on interests that showcase your positive qualities and strengths.

    The self-evaluation section in a resume is a section where you can evaluate and assess your own skills, strengths, and weaknesses. It is typically a short paragraph or bullet points at the end of your resume, which provides a personal perspective on your abilities and how they align with the requirements of the job.

    In this section, you can highlight your achievements, areas of expertise, and any unique qualities or experiences that set you apart from other candidates. You can also mention areas where you are looking to improve or gain further experience.

    A well-crafted self-evaluation section can demonstrate your self-awareness and confidence in your abilities, as well as your willingness to continuously learn and grow. However, it is important to be honest and avoid over-inflating your skills or qualifications, as this can negatively impact your credibility and the hiring manager's impression of you.
